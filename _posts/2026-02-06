My name is Matthew Curran and I'm an Electrical Engineering student at Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador. I am currently on a work term with the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, I am working with the Provincial Radio Communications Office and Bell 
Canada on our provinces emergency response radios for first responders. In my free time, I love to play volleyball; I coach a high school team at Holy Heart of Mary High School and weather pending I try to make as many ski trips possible throughout the winter season.

On this site you'll find a collection of projects, of personal and academic type, from my work terms and from the design team that I am a part of - Valiant Aero Tech
